Transformative Goals

The DevOps model unites development and IT operations to create a powerful organizational culture to achieve business goals more efficiently. Formerly siloed teams can now collaborate continuously to build more robust products, with increased confidence, and achieve business goals faster. The model has the power to transform operations, but there are barriers to DevOps that must be overcome first.
A Rocky Road to Great Riches

A DevOps culture can revitalize an organization, but there are barriers to implementation that must first be addressed. Overcome these hurdles to ensure a smooth shift to a DevOps model and success in its implementation.

9 Barriers to DevOps:
====
A recent survey of 2,000 IT executives conducted by cloud sandbox software company Quali highlighted these top 9 barriers to DevOps implementation:

    Culture: Many understand the importance of culture when it comes to DevOps. Few IT executives understand HOW to cultivate a successful DevOps culture.
    Test Automation: Continuous testing a vital part of the DevOps model but often gets forgotten in the organized chaos. Implement AlertOps and set triggers to automatically kick-off tests
    Legacy systems: Introducing new tools or systems into existing ones can be tough. Implement AlertOps, with an open API, for easy integration into all your systems allowing for enhanced visibility and incident response automation.
    Application Complexity: Few IT executives account for application architecture changes during deployment processes.
    No Plan: Many executives fail to develop a DevOps strategy or a set of goals to strive toward
    Managing Environments: DevOps operations become complex when there is a lack of standardization and automation. Implement AlertOps into your DevOps model to automate processes such as alert escalation and streamline real-time collaboration
    Skillset: Finding talented developers and ITOps professionals, capable of working together to achieve common goals, is a major hurdle for many organizations.
    Budget: DevOps ultimately aims to reduce an organization’s incident response cost, yet only a few take the time to develop a DevOps budget
    Tools: Fragmented tool adoption limits the overall performance of a DevOps team. Implement AlertOps to easily integrate into processes and ensure teams don’t have to work with cookie-cutter solutions.

Conclusion
=====

DevOps can be a game-changer for organizations big and small. However, these barriers must be overcome for teams to find success in the model. Implementing holistic tools such as AlertOps can help address these hurdles and ensure a sound transition to DevOps, leading to more cost-effective product deployment and increased revenue.
